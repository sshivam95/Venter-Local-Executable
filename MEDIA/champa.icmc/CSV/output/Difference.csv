Bad Patches,Odour  foul smell  from drains,Person falling in Manhole,Respected Sri Vijaya Kumar \nThis is to highlight the fact that even around your office in 4th T Block  the cleanliness of the streets and collection of garbage is very poor. Please take a look next to the temple behind your office and see the permanent garbage pile which stinks nonstop. Please see how garbage is merely swept up into piles all over 33-36 Cross / 22nd - 18th Main areas (all around your office) instead of being collected by the sweepers and by the garbage autos. This is prime area with judges  senior executives  industrialists etc staying here (although everyone has the right to a clean street!) Trust you will have the concerned people from BVG India do  their job properly. In order to avoid harassment by BBMP workers I have not provided my actual mobile number. Thank you.\n-Shankar

Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Person falling in Manhole,In every bus stop it is a very common issue that when a bus stops for passengers to board or alight a bunch of bikers and a couple of autos squeeze themselves between the passengers and buses making it dangerous for the passengers to embark/dis-embark from the buses. \n\nThey try to avoid the traffic by taking a ride on the safety of passengers.

Bad Patches,Repair to damaged open SWD,Major repairs to municipal property,Location: 3rd A Cross  6th F Main  near the temple beside Lumina Stars School  Gaurvnagar  J P Nagar 7th Phase.    The road in middle is going down. It is a very old problem. Sometime back somebody repaired it by filling mud and sand. Now due to the recent rain  middle of the road is going down  making it difficult for pedestrians and motorists/two wheelers to drive.  Two wheelers try to avoid the middle portion  which makes pedestrian walking risky. Request urgent repair.
